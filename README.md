# Business site 
This collaborative project was to create a fictitious business and build a full-featured website in Sinatra. The requirements were for it to be least 4 separate pages, use photographs and use jQuery and JavaScript for interaction. The site should also have the option to contact the business using the Mandrill API to send an e-mail to the business owner.
